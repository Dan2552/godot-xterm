# GodotXterm (Unmaintained GDScript version!)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lihop/godot-xterm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lihop/godot-xterm)

**WARNING: The GDScript version of this project turned out to be very buggy and performed poorly. Therefore, it is no longer being developed or mantained. I have had much more success with a gdnative implementation using [libtsm](https://github.com/Aetf/libtsm) which can be viewed in the [master branch](https://github.com/lihop/godot-xterm/tree/) of this repo. You should use that instead.**

Xterm for Godot. This is still very much a work in progress.
Most of the credit goes to the authors of [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) as most of this code was taken from that project and translated to GDScript.

## Demo

If you are running Linux and have `which`, `bash` and `socat` installed you can run the main scene (`demo.tscn`) and it will try 
to connect the Terminal node to your system.

Otherwise you can check out the gif below:

## Testing

This project uses the awesome [Gut](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) (Godot Unit Testing) plugin for testing.
You can run the tests by playing the test scene at `res://test/test.tscn` and clicking run.
